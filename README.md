**Popular algorithms for data science and machine learning**

## What is this book about?
Machine learning has gained tremendous popularity for its powerful and fast predictions with large datasets. However, the true forces behind its powerful output are the complex algorithms involving substantial statistical analysis that churn large datasets and generate substantial insight.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Study feature selection and the feature engineering process
* Assess performance and error trade-offs for linear regression
* Build a data model and understand how it works by using different types of algorithm
* Learn to tune the parameters of Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Explore the concept of natural language processing (NLP) and recommendation systems

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
svc = SVC(kernel='linear')
print(cross_val_score(svc, X, Y, scoring='accuracy', cv=10).mean())
0.93191356542617032
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
Machine Learning Algorithms is for you if you are a machine learning engineer, data engineer, or junior data scientist who wants to advance in the field of predictive analytics and machine learning. Familiarity with R and Python will be an added advantage for getting the best from this book.
